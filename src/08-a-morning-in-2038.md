# CHAPTER EIGHT: A MORNING IN 2038

### *The texture of ordinary life in the world that emerged*

It is five forty-five in the morning, and Thomas is in his kitchen.

He gets up this early not because he has to — the community's automated systems could manage bread distribution without him, have offered to manage it, and he has declined the offer politely and repeatedly — but because the morning bread is the most important thing he does, and important things deserve the most careful time. He has learned, in twenty-three years of baking, that the early morning has a quality of attention that other times of day do not: the house quiet, the city quiet, the particular quality of consciousness that comes just after sleep, before the day's accumulation of small decisions has consumed the attention's cleanest hours.

The sourdough culture sits on the counter in its crock, where it has been fermenting overnight. It is the descendant of a culture his grandmother maintained for forty years before passing it to his mother, who maintained it for twenty, who gave it to him when he moved to this community a decade ago. The culture carries within it — in the specific ecology of its bacteria, in the mineral profile of the water it has always been fed with — the accumulated history of the places it has been. You cannot replicate a sourdough culture. You can only receive one, maintain it, and eventually pass it on.

He measures the flour. Not by weight, though the weight is consistent with good flour in good conditions. By feel — the resistance of the flour as it falls through his fingers, the quality of the dry mix before the water is added. He has done this often enough that the measurement lives in his hands rather than in his mind. His hands know things about bread that his mind cannot fully articulate and that no AI system has yet succeeded in modeling from the outside.

## The Bread, and What It Is For

While the bread undergoes its first proof — an hour, in the warmth of the kitchen's passive solar wall — Thomas makes coffee and opens his notebook.

He keeps a baker's journal. Not a recipe journal — the recipes are in his hands, not on paper. A thinking journal: the questions and observations that arise from the practice of bread and that the practice seems designed to generate. This morning he is thinking about a conversation from yesterday, when a woman in the community asked if she could learn to bake. She is thirty-one, recently moved here after the cascade dissolved her career in financial analysis, and she is in the stage that Thomas recognizes: the stage where a person is genuinely open, where the old framework has gone and the new one has not yet formed, where almost anything could become the practice that organizes the next chapter of a life.

He agreed to teach her. He is now thinking about what teaching baking actually is.

The information is not the hard part. Anyone can learn the information: the ratios, the temperatures, the sequence of actions, the signs that indicate readiness at each stage. The information can be given in an afternoon. But baking is not information. It is a way of being present with materials that are alive and responsive and unpredictable, and that require a specific quality of attention — not the aggressive, problem-solving attention that his student's previous career had trained, but a receptive, patient attention that notices what is happening and responds to it rather than directing it.

This quality of attention cannot be given in an afternoon. It develops through repetition, through failure, through the specific experience of being wrong about what the dough needs and then observing the consequence of that wrongness. His student will fail for the first months. She will under-proof and over-proof, she will tear the gluten, she will bake too hot and too cool, she will produce bread that is edible but not beautiful and not what she intended.

And in the failing, if she stays with it, she will develop the attention the failing requires. The attention will generalize. This is the thing that skills learned at depth always do: they change the quality of attention available in other contexts. The baker who learns to truly pay attention to bread learns something about attention itself — something that becomes available across all of her experience, not only in the kitchen.

He writes this in his notebook, not because he has not thought it before but because writing it again, in this morning's light, with this morning's quality of consciousness, produces a slightly different version. The practice of writing about the practice keeps the practice from going stiff.

## Across the City: Elena in Her Lab

At seven thirty, Elena arrives at her lab.

The lab is quieter than it was in 2027 — quieter in the sense that there are fewer people in it at any given time. She used to manage a team of seven postdoctoral researchers, each focused on a specific dimension of the protein folding question, each requiring the kind of regular oversight and mentorship that is the significant invisible labor of running a research group. She now works with two postdocs and an AI research system of considerable sophistication, and the work they produce together is more ambitious and more comprehensive than anything she produced with the larger team.

She checks the system's overnight outputs first. This is the ritual that has replaced her old habit of checking email: the AI system runs while she sleeps, processing the day's experimental data, scanning the literature for relevant developments, generating and evaluating hypotheses, and producing a summary of what it has found. The summary is the thing she reads at breakfast, at the kitchen table at home, before she comes to the lab — she has learned not to read it in the lab, where the laboratory context immediately produces the experimental mind, the part of her that wants to begin. Reading it at breakfast allows the reflective mind to engage first, the part that evaluates and contextualizes and asks whether the hypothesis is interesting before asking whether it is testable.

The thing the system found overnight is interesting. More than interesting: it may be the thing she has been looking for, or the beginning of it. She spent the walk to the lab turning it over, trying to find the objections, trying to find the places where the reasoning was weak or the underlying assumptions were wrong. She found two places. Both are addressable with experiments her team can run this week.

She calls Benjamin. He is a second-generation researcher in a specific sense: he grew up in a community organized around contemplative practice, and the quality of attention he brings to scientific work is distinctive — more patient, less oriented toward the quick result, more comfortable with the productive confusion that genuine research requires. Elena hired him partly for this. She had spent years surrounded by brilliant postdocs who were brilliant in the anxious, productive way that the previous era's academic training produced, and she found that the postdocs who could sit with genuine uncertainty — who did not panic when the experiment failed, who were interested in the failure — produced better science in the long run.

"The overnight output," she says when he picks up.

"I read it on the way in," he says. He is a twelve-minute walk from the lab, and he has been reading while he walks in the careful way of someone who knows the path well enough to trust his feet. "The membrane permeability assumption."

"That's one of the two places," she says.

"What's the other?"

She tells him. He is silent for a moment. "That one's worse," he says.

"Yes. But also addressable."

"What's the experiment?"

She tells him. Another silence, longer this time — she can hear him thinking through the protocol, evaluating what it would require, where the confounds are, how long it will take.

"We can do it," he says. "Two weeks, if we optimize."

"Let's design it this afternoon."

She hangs up and stands at the window of her office, which looks onto the courtyard where someone has planted a garden that has been growing for three years and that is now, in late summer, densely green and slightly chaotic in the way of gardens that have been given enough and left to express their own intelligence. She has been looking at this garden for three years and finds it consistently interesting. She is not sure why. Perhaps because the garden, like the research, is always doing something that was not predicted.

## On the Edge of the City: Priya at the Community

At five in the morning — earlier than Thomas, earlier than anyone else — Priya is in the sitting hall.

She comes to this room an hour before the community's collective morning sitting begins, because an hour of solitary practice establishes the quality of attention she wants to bring to the collective session, and because the room itself, empty and quiet, has a quality that the room with forty-seven people in it, however attentive, does not have. She sits. She does not follow any specific tradition's instruction, though she has trained in several and carries their methods in the way that a carpenter who has studied under multiple masters carries all of their methods and has distilled from them something that is distinctively her own.

What she is doing is difficult to describe from outside, because the territory she is in is one that requires the practice to understand and that changes the practitioner in ways that change the access to description. The traditional language — *meditation*, *contemplation*, *mindfulness* — all gestures at something real while missing most of what is real. The thing she is doing is more specific than *meditation* in the way that surgery is more specific than *medicine*: it is a precise intervention in the conditions of consciousness, aimed at something specific, using methods developed through decades of careful empirical investigation.

What it produces, this morning as on most mornings: a quality of awareness that she experiences as more complete than ordinary waking awareness. Not more pleasant, necessarily — the quality can be applied to things that are painful, and the application does not make them less painful. More *present*: less filtered by the habitual interpretive frameworks that ordinarily stand between raw experience and consciousness, less reactive to the habitual triggers that ordinarily produce automatic responses. She is, in this quality of awareness, more genuinely herself — more able to respond to what is actually happening rather than to her interpretation of what is happening.

At six, the other community members begin to arrive.

Forty-seven people in a warm room. Wooden floors that have been swept clean. East-facing windows that will admit the morning light when the sun clears the ridge in about forty minutes. The people come quietly and sit with the quality of people who have been coming to this room for years and who know what the room is for. A grandmother who has been in this community since it was founded twenty-two years ago and who has been practicing for sixty years and who carries in her stillness something that all the other practitioners can feel. A man of thirty who came six months ago and is still finding his footing but who comes every morning without fail. Aisha's father, who does not practice mathematics but does this, consistently, and who says when asked that the two practices are teaching him the same thing about attention from different directions.

The sitting lasts ninety minutes. At its end, the community eats breakfast together — Thomas's bread, from the community's collective oven, and fruit and eggs from the small farm two kilometers away. The conversation is easy and warm, the kind that long familiarity with people makes easy: genuine interest in each other's lives without the performance that acquaintance requires.

## At the School: Dr. Chen Preparing

Dr. Chen arrives at his school at eight.

He is carrying, in addition to his bag with its notebooks and the problems he has chosen for today's session, a pot of chrysanthemum tea that he makes every morning and drinks throughout the teaching day. He has been making this tea for thirty years. It is a habit that had no particular origin — someone gave him the tea once and he liked it — and that has become, through repetition, a ritual: the making of it is one of the signals that the teaching day is beginning, that his attention is organizing itself toward the students it will be responsible for.

He walks through the school before the students arrive. He reads the notes left from yesterday on the whiteboard — not erased, because sometimes the conversation from one session is the right beginning for the next. He reads Aisha's notebook, which she leaves open on her table when the session ends and which he reads with the same quality of attention he reads the notes of the students from thirty years ago, looking for the specific shape of the current understanding. He adjusts, in his mind, the problems he has prepared — Aisha's overnight development has moved her further than he expected, and the problem he had planned for her is now slightly too easy. He replaces it with something harder.

This adjustment — the reading of where a student actually is and the redesign of the day's challenge to meet them there — is the practical skill of teaching at depth. It requires that the teacher know the student well enough to read their current state from the traces they leave, and it requires that the teacher have enough domain knowledge that the redesign can happen in real time without the quality of the challenge suffering. It is not something an AI system can do, though an AI system with access to the student's work history can provide useful context for the teacher's judgment.

The students begin to arrive. Aisha is first, as she usually is. She has Thomas's bread and the particular quality of alertness that suggests she has been thinking since she woke up.

"You had something?" Dr. Chen asks.

"I think so," she says, sitting down and opening her notebook. "I don't know if it's right."

"Show me."

The morning begins.

## What This Morning Is

I have described four people in one morning, in one city, in one small region of the world that emerged from the cascade. Each of them is doing something that is, in the obvious sense, unremarkable: baking, researching, sitting, teaching. These are not the dramatic activities that most accounts of civilizational transformation focus on. They do not look like history.

But the quality of attention that each of them brings to what they are doing — the care, the depth, the genuine engagement with what is actually in front of them — is the thing that the new civilization is organized to produce. And it is genuinely different from the quality of attention that the productivity economy organized people toward: faster, more distributed, more performative, less genuinely present to the specific thing in front of it.

Thomas's bread is different from automated bread because Thomas is actually present with it. Elena's research is different from AI-generated research output because Elena is actually present with the question — invested in it, caring about it, bringing to it not just processing power but the particular quality of human curiosity that wants to know because knowing matters. Priya's practice is different from any simulation of practice because Priya is actually in the experience — the development occurring in her, not in any external record of her. Dr. Chen's teaching is different from any tutorial system because Dr. Chen is actually attending to Aisha — reading her, adjusting to her, present with the specific quality of her current understanding in a way that only long and genuine relationship makes possible.

The morning is ordinary. The morning is also the thing the civilization is for.
