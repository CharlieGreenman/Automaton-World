# CHAPTER FIVE: THE NEW ECONOMY

### *What replaced markets when the machines took production*

Sera is still building.

She is forty-seven now, and her ambition, far from diminishing with the years, has taken on a quality that the people who work with her describe as something between intensity and serenity — as if she has found the level of difficulty exactly equal to her capacity, and has been working at that level for so long that the strain and the pleasure have become indistinguishable.

"People ask me if I miss the old work," she says, in the way she says things that she has thought about carefully. "I used to move shipping containers. I built systems that moved a million things at once, at the kind of scale that required ASI just to model. Now I am building systems that help eight billion people figure out how to live. The scale went up. The difficulty went up. The stakes went up. Everything the old world told me was impossible — building without profit, funding without metrics, governing without coercion — I get to attempt. How is that not the most exciting thing a founder has ever been offered?"

The architecture she has built — what she called, in the early years, the largest infrastructure project in human history that no one could see — is now operational in most of the developed world and in expanding networks across every populated continent. It does not look like what people imagined when they imagined the replacement of market capitalism. It does not look like any of the ideological alternatives that competed for attention in the political upheaval years. It looks, when you are inside it, like something that grew rather than was designed: organic, adaptive, drawing on traditions of exchange that predate industrial capitalism by millennia.

Understanding it requires starting with the problem it was built to solve.

## The Problem With the Surplus

When ASI and its associated automation took production — not just routine production but the production that had required genuine intelligence and skill — the economic surplus did not disappear. It grew. The machines generated more wealth than the human labor they replaced had generated, because the machines were more efficient and could operate continuously and could be coordinated at a scale and precision that human labor never could.

The problem was not that there was not enough. The problem was that the logic by which the surplus had been distributed — the labor market, which matched human capability to economic need and delivered income as the exchange — had dissolved. The machines did not need income. The people who had provided the labor did need income, and the machines had taken their work.

The initial political response — emergency income programs — was right in its recognition that the income floor needed to be maintained, and wrong in its assumption that the programs would be temporary. The jobs did not come back, not in the categories and at the scale that the programs assumed. The programs were extended. And extended again. And in the extending, a political reality became clear that had previously been obscured by the convenient fiction of the temporary support program: the question of how the ASI-generated surplus would be distributed was not a crisis-management question. It was a permanent civilizational question.

The answer that emerged — slowly, imperfectly, through real political battles and genuine compromises — was the sovereign endowment model.

## The Sovereign Endowment

The mechanisms varied by country, shaped by political tradition and existing law. In some places it was a wealth tax specifically on AI-generated income above a threshold, permanently endowing a public fund. In others it was a requirement that companies above a certain capability threshold issue equity to a sovereign fund as a condition of operating their systems. In several countries it involved direct public ownership of AI capability. In the international framework, it included provisions for cross-border redistribution that addressed the uneven global distribution of AI capacity.

The result, across these variations, was similar: a permanent public endowment, funded by ongoing AI-generated productivity, that served two purposes.

The first: a universal income floor. Not means-tested, not conditional on job-seeking, not temporary. A basic material security available to every person, sufficient to meet basic needs without requiring productive contribution in the economic sense. This was the political breakthrough that the decade of argument about universal basic income had been circling without achieving: it became politically feasible not through ideological persuasion but through the simple arithmetic of necessity. No government that wanted to remain in power could maintain a system that required people to participate in labor markets that no longer had room for them.

The second purpose — less visible but at least as important — was the funding of the new institutions of human flourishing. The Schools of Depth, the new monasteries, the communities of relation, the consciousness research institutes, the governance design bodies. These institutions could not be funded by markets, because they produce nothing that markets can easily value. They could not be funded by philanthropy, because their scale and permanence exceeds what voluntary individual giving can support. They required something like what the great medieval endowments provided for universities and monasteries: a permanent capital base, managed by trustees accountable to the community, generating income that could be deployed in support of human flourishing rather than human productivity.

The endowment does not eliminate inequality. The distributions it produces account for different costs of living, different community needs, different choices that individuals and communities make about how to organize their lives. And the wealth generated by AI systems is not evenly distributed between nations — a problem the international governance structures are still struggling with, slowly and imperfectly. But within the economies where it operates, the endowment has done the one thing that matters most: it has made the material security of every person unconditional.

The conditionality change is harder to absorb than it sounds. For generations, the social contract had been: contribute and receive. Work and earn. Be productive and belong. The endowment breaks this contract not by destroying it but by making it voluntary. You can still work. You can still build. You can still earn, in the markets that remain. But you do not have to in order to live.

And this — the simple fact of not having to — changed what people did with their days in ways that no economic model had fully captured. Not because people are lazy. The evidence is very clear that most people, given unconditional security, do not spend their days in passive leisure. They do things. The things they do are different from what they did when economic necessity organized their choices. They are, on average and in the aggregate, more genuinely interesting and more genuinely valuable — not to markets, but to the people doing them and the communities they serve.

## The Metrics Trap, and How Sera Cracked It

The hardest piece of the architecture was funding the new institutions without destroying them through the logic of measurement.

The problem has a name — Sera calls it the *metrics trap* — and its mechanism is simple. To distribute resources responsibly, you need criteria. Criteria require measurement. Measurement requires defining success. And defining success changes the activity: people optimize for the metric rather than for the thing the metric was supposed to track. The School of Depth whose funding is contingent on demonstrating "educational depth outcomes" is no longer a School of Depth. It is a performer of whatever behaviors have been defined as proxies for depth. The contemplative community whose endowment requires quarterly reports of "contemplative development" is no longer contemplating. It is producing contemplation documentation.

This is not a theoretical problem. It is the problem that has destroyed every attempt to fund genuine human flourishing through the logic of industrial capitalism. The arts grants that produced grant-maximizing artists. The education funding that produced test-maximizing schools. The healthcare funding that produced visit-maximizing physicians. The metric is always wrong, and making it more sophisticated only makes the optimization more sophisticated.

Sera's solution was the commons fund model — a nested architecture of trust-based funding that operates from the local to the planetary level.

At the local level: small committees of people who know the applicants personally and have observed their work over time. These committees make funding decisions on the basis of a single criterion: *genuine depth of engagement*. Not outputs. Not metrics. The judgment of people who can recognize the real thing when they see it, because they have gone deep enough themselves to know what it looks like.

At the regional level: networks of local committees that share resources, coordinate across communities, and fund the institutions that are too large for any single local committee to support. The regional bodies are accountable to the local ones — their decisions can be appealed, their records are transparent, and their members are chosen by the local committees they serve.

At the planetary level: the framework that coordinates it all — the allocation of sovereign endowment funds, the protection of the model's integrity against capture by commercial or political interests, the standards that define what constitutes genuine depth in each domain.

The model is not immune to exploitation. No trust-based system is. People misrepresent themselves. Committees make mistakes. The history of patronage — which is, in its structure, what the commons fund model is — is full of bad decisions and captured judgments. Sera knew this when she designed the model. She built in mechanisms for correction: transparency requirements, appeal processes, mandatory rotation of committee membership, the ability of funded institutions to appeal directly to higher levels if their local committee has been captured.

The committee that funds Elena's consciousness research does not require her to demonstrate quarterly progress. They require her to show up, once a year, and talk honestly about what she is learning — what is working, what is not, what she now understands about the domain that she did not understand before. The conversation is what the funding is based on: the quality of her thinking, the honesty of her account of failure and success, the evident genuineness of her engagement with the question.

She told me once that this conversation, which takes four hours and happens in a room with seven people who have read everything she has written and who ask hard questions, is the most useful four hours in her year. Not because they tell her what to do. Because they take her work seriously enough to challenge it, and the challenge is itself a form of support.

## The Markets That Survived

Not everything about the old market economy dissolved. Some markets proved surprisingly durable, and the reason they proved durable tells something true about what markets are actually good at.

**Craft markets survived.** The made object — genuinely made by hands, in a process that required the specific knowledge and care of a specific person — commands enormous regard in the new economy. Not because it is technically superior to the automated product (often it is not) but because it carries, inextricably, the presence of the person who made it.

The economics of craft have changed completely. Most exchange in craft happens outside conventional currency: through the gift economy, through direct exchange, through the reputation systems that have developed as alternatives to price. But where currency is involved — where the work is sold in the conventional sense — what is being sold is not an object. It is a relationship with a practice, with a person, with a tradition. The person who buys a chair from a craftsperson who has spent twenty years studying the wood has purchased something that the automated furniture system, however technically excellent, cannot produce: evidence of human attention extended over time.

**Teaching and mentorship markets survived.** The transmission of genuine knowledge from one person to another — not information transfer, which AI systems do extraordinarily — but the formation of a person in a domain, remained irreducibly human. The people who had gone genuinely deep in any domain and could bring another person toward that depth found that this was recognized as valuable in the new economy. Not in the credential-selling way of the old educational market. In the direct, relational way of the master-apprentice relationship: the student who finds a teacher who can bring her genuinely further pays for it, or finds it paid for by the commons fund, or contributes something other than money that the teacher values.

**Experience markets survived.** Not the experience economy of the late industrial era — the branded experiences, the curated adventures, the packaged authenticity that was itself a form of production. The genuine experience economy: performances by specific people for specific audiences, gatherings of specific communities in specific places, the kinds of events that require physical presence and cannot be replicated or streamed without losing what makes them valuable.

**Land and place markets survived.** As noted in the previous chapter, land is ultimately finite and the desire to be in the best places is a form of competition that no automation can dissolve. What changed was the criterion of "best" — which shifted from proximity to economic opportunity to richness in genuine community. But the exchange of access to place continued to be organized by markets, complicated by the community governance structures that now regulate land use more actively than before.

## What Money Is For Now

Money in the new economy is not primarily for meeting basic needs — those are met by the endowment. It is for access: to the particular goods and experiences that remain in limited supply, to the domains of craft and mentorship and genuine experience that the markets have preserved, and to the communities that require a demonstrated commitment to something that can be expressed financially.

This changes the psychological relationship to money. The person whose basic needs are unconditionally secured does not experience money as survival — does not experience the loss of it as existential threat, and does not pursue it with the desperation of someone for whom it represents safety. They experience it as a tool for access, and they pursue it (or do not pursue it) based on what they actually want access to.

This shift is among the most profound in the texture of daily life, and it is also the hardest to fully convey to someone who has not experienced it. The anxiety that money-as-survival produces is pervasive and difficult to see from inside it. It colors every decision, including decisions that appear unrelated to money. It makes people less generous, less patient, less willing to take risks, less able to attend to what matters most. Removing that anxiety — making material security genuinely unconditional rather than contingent — does not eliminate anxiety (there are always other things to be anxious about) but it removes the specific, profound, civilization-wide distortion that money-as-survival had produced.

The people who accumulate significant wealth in the new economy — who earn far more than the endowment provides, through the markets that survive — are doing so, for the most part, for reasons that are not survival. Some do it for the access it provides. Some do it because accumulation is the form their competitive drive takes, and human competitive drive does not dissolve when its material necessity does. Some do it because they are building something that requires capital at a scale the commons fund does not provide. All of these are recognizable human motivations. None of them requires organizing a civilization around the maximization of wealth.

## A Market, Late Afternoon

Sera crosses the market square in a mid-sized city that has been piloting one of her architecture's local instantiations for three years.

The market is not large — a hundred stalls, perhaps, in a square that can hold them comfortably while leaving room for people to sit and eat and talk. It runs three days a week. It sells: the particular food that the small farms and the home kitchens produce, the objects that the craftspeople make, the access to the teaching that the masters offer, the tickets to the performances that the performing communities put on. Everything sold here has the quality of particularity: it comes from someone specific, made by specific hands or grown in specific soil or taught by a specific person who has spent decades in a domain.

Most of the exchange is not monetary. The farmer who brings the vegetables goes home with bread from the baker and a conversation with the weaver that is, in its way, payment of its own — the recognition of someone whose work you respect, the exchange of genuine attention. The monetary exchanges that occur are handled through accounts connected to the commons fund and to the local trust networks, the numbers recorded and the balance tracked in systems that Sera helped design and that she still finds imperfect in ways she is continuing to address.

But the imperfection does not bother her the way it used to. She has learned, over fourteen years of building at civilizational scale, to distinguish between the things that need to be perfect and the things that need to be good enough to function. The market is good enough. People are eating, and trading, and talking, and the quality of the transactions is genuinely relational in the way she designed the architecture to produce.

She stops at Thomas's bread stall. He has been here since five in the morning and his stall shows it — the remaining loaves fewer than the morning but the atmosphere around the stall richer, the conversations longer, the people who stop to buy also stopping to talk about how the bread has been lately and what he is trying next. Thomas is one of the people in whom Sera's architecture produces exactly what she designed it to produce: a master in full possession of a practice, in genuine relationship with the community the practice serves, doing the work because the work is the point.

She buys a loaf. Pays with her commons account, which is ridiculous for bread — the loaf costs nothing material — but Thomas insists on the form, because the form maintains the dignity of the exchange. She walks on.

The market continues. The civilization that Sera has spent fourteen years building continues. She is nowhere near done.
