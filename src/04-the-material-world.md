# CHAPTER FOUR: THE MATERIAL WORLD

### *What life actually looks like when the machines handle abundance*

Let me be concrete.

One of the consistent failures of thinking about the post-scarcity future has been the tendency toward abstraction at exactly the moment when concreteness is most needed. The economists describe distributions and growth rates. The philosophers describe value systems and frameworks for meaning. The technologists describe capability curves and deployment timelines. What is missing, almost always, is the texture: what does it actually feel like to live in this world? What does a home look like? What do people eat? What are the streets like? What does the air smell like?

These questions are not trivial. The texture of daily life shapes the quality of consciousness in ways that no abstract description captures. The material conditions of existence are not backdrop to human experience — they constitute much of it. The civilization that inhabits warm rooms and eats food grown with care in specific soil is not experiencing the same quality of consciousness as the civilization that inhabits identical units and consumes nutrition optimized for efficiency.

So: here is what the world looks like, materially, in 2037.

## Energy

The energy transition happened faster than almost anyone projected, and in a different configuration than the forecasters predicted. It was not solar alone, or fusion alone, or wind alone, or nuclear alone. It was all of these, optimized and coordinated in real time by AI systems sophisticated enough to route power across continental grids with a precision that no human engineering team could have managed.

The fusion breakthrough — achieved in 2031, scaled commercially by 2034 — was the pivotal moment. Not because fusion power was immediately dominant (it was not; the grid continued to draw from multiple sources) but because the credible prospect of unlimited clean energy changed the planning horizon for everything that depended on energy. The calculation changed. The long-term logic of energy abundance became the basis for infrastructure investment across the entire economy.

By 2037, energy costs in the developed world have fallen to levels that make most energy-intensive activities effectively free for most practical human purposes. You do not think about energy when you heat your home or cool it. You do not route your day based on charging availability. You do not forgo a warm meal or a lit room because of what the energy to produce it costs.

*Effectively free* does not mean free. There are still pricing structures, still incentives for efficiency during peak demand, still the ongoing cost of maintaining the grid infrastructure. But the cognitive burden of managing energy costs — the constant background awareness, in the previous era, of what was running and what it cost — has lifted. This is harder to absorb than it sounds. The background hum of scarcity had organized so many small decisions for so long that its absence creates a strange new spaciousness in daily life. Room for attention to flow toward things it had been too busy monitoring to reach.

## Food

Food is the more complicated story, and I want to tell it carefully because it reveals something important about the relationship between material abundance and human meaning.

The calorie problem was solved quickly and definitively. Precision fermentation, AI-optimized agriculture, advanced vertical farming — by 2033, the production of adequate nutrition had been separated from the constraints of climate, seasonality, geography, and conventional farmland. Famine had become close to impossible in any part of the world with basic infrastructure. This was the thing that the previous generation had worked toward for decades, and it arrived, and it was unambiguously good.

The food that ended hunger is not the food that ended the desire for particular food. This is the thing that food scientists had predicted and that the actual human response to nutritional abundance proved correct in a way that still surprises economists when they graph the data.

The automated nutrition facilities that produce most of the caloric foundation of the 2037 diet are extraordinary achievements of engineering. They produce food that is nutritionally optimal, safe, consistently palatable, and cheap to the point of irrelevance in terms of cost. They are also experienced, by most people who rely on them as a primary food source, as food with no soul.

Soul is not a nutritional category. It is not measurable by any instrument in a food laboratory. But it is real, in the sense that its presence or absence has measurable effects on the experience of eating and on the frequency with which people seek out alternatives. Food that carries no trace of the particular — no evidence of the specific soil, the specific season, the specific person who grew or prepared it — is experienced as adequate in the way that a waiting room is adequate: it meets the functional need without providing anything beyond the function.

The consequence is a bifurcated food culture. The automated facilities provide the nutritional floor — abundant, accessible, never allowing anyone to go hungry. Alongside them, an extraordinarily rich culture of particular food has developed: the small farms, the neighborhood bakeries, the home kitchens, the community gardens, the fermentation clubs, the people who have made the growing and preparing of food their primary practice and who share what they make with the people around them.

This particular food culture is not primarily commercial. The exchanges that organize it are not primarily monetary. They are relational: the baker who gives a loaf to a neighbor because the neighbor helped with the garden; the farmer who brings vegetables to the community distribution point because the community council helped resolve a water rights dispute; the person who makes the extraordinary jam because making extraordinary jam is how they express care for the people they love.

Thomas's bread — which anyone who knows him experiences as among the most important recurring pleasures of their week — is not sold. It is given. The giving is not charity; it is not pity-directed toward people who could not otherwise afford bread. It is the expression of a philosophy about what food is, and what the making of it is for: an act of care, specific to specific people, that no automated system could replicate without ceasing to be what it is.

## Housing

Housing was harder than the technology enthusiasts predicted, and in ways that reveal something true about what human beings actually want when given the freedom to want it.

Construction was significantly disrupted by automation. Robotic building systems became capable of complex structural work at speed and quality that made conventional construction labor largely redundant. Materials became dramatically cheaper as manufacturing automated. Architectural design became accessible to anyone — AI systems could produce plans of genuine aesthetic quality for any specification. All of this should have produced abundant, affordable housing everywhere.

In some places it did. In places where the constraint on housing had genuinely been the cost of construction — which was true in many parts of the developing world — the housing supply expanded dramatically. Cities that had struggled for decades with informal settlements found that the material conditions for decent housing were suddenly achievable, and they built it.

But in the developed world, the housing problem turned out to be primarily a land problem, and land is not solved by making construction cheaper. The places where people wanted to live were still the places where other people were already living — places with established community, interesting culture, access to the physical landscape that people love. And these places are finite, and the desire to be in the best of them is a form of competition that no amount of automation can dissolve.

What changed was the definition of "best." In the productivity era, the most desirable places were the ones closest to economic opportunity — the major cities with the most jobs and the highest wages. This logic evaporated with the labor markets. In the new world, the most desirable places are the ones richest in genuine community, in walking access to places worth walking to, in the kind of neighborhood texture that only develops over decades of human life.

This revaluation shifted where people wanted to be. The mega-cities of the late industrial era — organized around the concentration of economic activity — began to thin at their edges, their commuter peripheries depopulating as the economic logic that had built them dissolved. Simultaneously, medium-sized cities and small towns with genuine character and genuine community attracted people in ways that surprised urban planners who had been predicting continued mega-city growth.

The physical design of new housing changed in ways that took several years to become visible as a trend. The aesthetic of maximized square footage gave way to an aesthetic of warmth and human scale. Rooms designed to accumulate the evidence of a life — high ceilings, natural materials, windows positioned for the light that falls at a particular time of day — proved more desirable than the efficient minimalism that had dominated luxury housing in the previous decade.

The most desirable homes in 2037 are the ones embedded in genuine community: on streets where people actually walk, near spaces where people actually gather, with room for the extended family and the occasional guest and the practice that requires physical space. The neighborhood matters more than the square footage.

## Healthcare

Healthcare changed in a way that felt like it should have resolved more suffering than it did, and the gap between what was technically achieved and what was experientially delivered tells something important about the nature of human suffering.

The diagnostic capabilities of AI systems transformed medicine's technical dimensions. Most cancers, caught by the population-level monitoring systems that now analyze biomarkers in routine blood work, are identified at stages where treatment is highly effective. Most genetic diseases can be screened and addressed. The bacterial and viral infections that killed people in previous centuries are manageable by therapies that make the previous era's antibiotics look crude and clumsy. Longevity in the developed world has extended to a degree that has created new social planning challenges — there are now more people over ninety than over ten in some European countries, and the institutions designed for a population with a shorter lifespan are being reconstructed in real time.

The life that is being extended is, in the material dimensions, healthier. The physical suffering associated with age has been reduced. The chronic pain conditions that had made the last decades of life miserable for millions of people are largely manageable. The cognitive decline of dementia — which was the great dread of the previous generation — is now understood and addressable well enough that its most severe forms are significantly reduced.

What did not change was the nature of suffering that is not primarily physical.

The extension of life revealed this with unusual clarity: people who were freed from physical suffering did not, for the most part, experience the extended years as years of joy. They experienced them as years that required *filling* — required, that is, genuine purpose and genuine relationship and genuine depth, the things that the previous civilization had provided through the organizing structure of productive work and that the new civilization had not yet fully replaced.

Loneliness became, in the extended years, a form of suffering as significant as any physical condition. Not the loneliness of isolation — the new institutions of community were, by 2037, sufficiently developed that isolation was rare for people who wanted community. But the deeper loneliness of a life that does not feel inhabited by genuine meaning: the experience of having time and health and material security and nothing that the time is urgently for.

This was not universal. The people who had gone genuinely deep into something — who had a practice, a community, a domain of inquiry that genuinely engaged them — experienced the extended years as the opportunity that extra time always represents: more of the thing that mattered. But for the people who arrived at seventy-five with good health and no organizing framework, the extension of life was itself a kind of problem, the specific problem of a narrative that has lost its direction and must find a new one.

The medical system of 2037 is grappling with this. The largest single category of human medical work has become what used to be called mental health care — a term that fails to capture the territory, since what is being addressed is less the pathological mind and more the unlived life. The physicians who do this work best are the ones who understand it as wisdom transmission rather than symptom management: people who have gone deeply enough into their own experience that they can recognize what is missing in another person's, and who can help, not by prescribing but by accompanying — by being present with a person in their genuine difficulty in a way that makes the difficulty more navigable.

## Geography: How the Civilization Spread

The geographic reorganization that the cascade produced is one of the most physically visible changes in the world of 2037, and one of the most significant for the quality of daily life.

The major industrial cities of the developed world have not collapsed or been abandoned. But they have thinned. The commuter peripheries are significantly depopulated; the logic that had driven suburban sprawl — that you accepted a long commute in exchange for affordable space near the city's economic center — evaporated with the economic center. The inner cities have in many cases intensified: the people who remain in major cities are the ones who genuinely want urban life, who value the density and the culture and the specific energy that only large concentrations of people produce.

But the population that has dispersed — the millions who have left the suburbs and the smaller cities that had been satellites of larger economic centers — has gone in several directions.

Many have gone home, in the literal sense: back to the places they or their parents came from, drawn by the extended family connections that proximity makes possible and by the lower cost of living in places where land is not scarce. These movements have revitalized some small cities and rural communities in ways that the previous era's regional economists had given up predicting would ever happen.

Many have joined intentional communities — communities formed explicitly around shared practice or shared values or both, often in rural or semi-rural settings where land is available and where the intentional design of the community is not constrained by existing urban infrastructure. These communities range from the very small (eight to twenty people, usually organized around a specific practice) to the medium-sized (a few hundred people, organized around a broader set of values with multiple practices coexisting within them).

The medium-sized cities that have grown — that have become genuine destinations rather than satellites of larger centers — are the ones that have figured out how to be genuinely themselves. They have distinct characters, built from specific concentrations of people attracted by those characters: a city known for its musical tradition, a city that has become a center for consciousness research and practice, a city where the food culture is extraordinary, a city where the craft traditions are so strong that it has become a training ground for artisans from around the world. These characters are not marketed or branded — they are the organic accumulation of the specific people who have chosen to live there and the specific things those people have built.

This geographic diversity is one of the most pleasant surprises of the post-cascade world: the sense that place matters again, that the specific character of a specific community is worth attending to, that the civilization has not homogenized into the uniform commercial landscape that the late industrial era had been producing. The world of 2037 is less uniform and more interesting than the world of 2027, geographically, because the economic forces that had been homogenizing it have been replaced by the human forces that have always created diversity when given the chance.

## What Home Looks Like

A last note, more personal than the others: what home actually looks like in this world.

The home of 2037 is warmer and more particular than the homes the previous era aspired to. Not because the aspiration has gotten worse — because it has gotten more honest. The professional staging of homes for real estate listings — the removal of all personal evidence from a space to make it look like everyone's space and no one's — disappeared when the economic drivers that had made it necessary dissolved. The homes people live in now look like someone lives in them.

They accumulate: the books read and reread, the objects made or received from people who made them, the artwork on the walls that is there because it matters to the person who put it there rather than because it was selected by a decorator for visual neutrality. The kitchen shows evidence of use. The garden shows evidence of care. The room that is being used for whatever the practice is — the instruments in the corner, the loom in the window, the workbench in the back — shows evidence of real, sustained engagement.

The homes are also, on the whole, smaller than the homes the previous era aspired to. The square footage aspiration — the house that was always bigger than what the inhabitants needed, because size was the primary signal of success — has given way to something more sensible: the space you actually need for the life you actually live. Which turns out to be less room and more quality of room: the ceiling high enough to live in, the window well-placed for the light, the hearth or its modern equivalent at the center.

Human beings need warmth. Not metaphorically. Literally: the physical warmth of rooms that welcome rather than impress, of light that serves the people in it, of spaces designed for the specific life lived in them rather than for a hypothetical universal user. The homes of 2037 are warm in this literal sense. And the warmth is one of the most immediately perceptible things about the texture of daily life — a quality of being received, materially, by the space one inhabits.

This is where the new civilization lives. In these warm rooms, in these particular neighborhoods, fed by this particular food, extended into healthy decades that create new pressure to fill them with genuine meaning. The material conditions are, by most measurable criteria, better than anything any previous civilization has enjoyed. They are also, in their very abundance, more demanding: they remove the excuses. The person who has warmth and food and health and time has been given the conditions for a genuinely good life, and what they do with those conditions is entirely their own.
