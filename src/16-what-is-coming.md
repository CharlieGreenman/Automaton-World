# CHAPTER SIXTEEN: WHAT IS COMING

### *2050, 2100, and the question that remains*

I want to look further.

Not as prediction — the honest epistemological position is that prediction at this range is impossible, and confident prediction is dishonest. The people who wrote confidently about what 2025 would look like, from the vantage point of 2000, were wrong in most of the specifics and occasionally right in the directions. Specific wrongness is instructive. The instruction does not prevent the attempt.

What follows is not prediction. It is the logical extension of the direction: if the trajectory holds, if the governance battles produce enough of the right outcomes, if the new institutions develop as their founders intend, if the civilization chooses depth over distraction in the proportions that make the choice real — what does the world look like further out?

I will be wrong. The specifics always are. Here, in the direction, is what I can see.

## 2050

The civilization of 2050 is recognizably the civilization described in the earlier chapters of this book, in its second decade. Not stable — nothing human is stable — but settled enough that its character is visible. The new institutions are established. The first generation raised entirely within the new framework is in its mid-twenties to mid-thirties, taking its place in the civilization's active life.

**The Schools of Depth** are in their second generation of leadership. Some founding masters are still alive and active; many have passed on, and the quality of their transmission has been tested by succession. The schools that have succeeded at succession are among the most important institutions in the civilization — places where genuine depth has accumulated across decades, where the knowledge of how to develop depth has been refined through thousands of encounters between teachers and students, where the domain knowledge and the pedagogical knowledge and the institutional knowledge are held together in an integrated practice.

There have been notable failures: schools that lost their founder and with them lost the quality that made the school worth attending, that became forms rather than practices, going through the motions of depth without the substance. The governance design field that Marcus's Institute initiated has studied these failures carefully, and the findings have been incorporated into the design of subsequent institutions. The failures were not wasted. Every failure in a system designed for learning teaches something, if the system is honest about the failure.

The domain of contemplative neuroscience has produced, in the two decades since Elena's early experiments, a body of knowledge substantial enough to be called a mature science. Not complete — no science is ever complete — but rigorous, reproducible, and genuinely explanatory: it now understands the mechanisms of contemplative development well enough to design interventions that reliably produce specific forms of development, to identify in advance the people for whom specific approaches are and are not appropriate, and to detect the failure modes early enough to correct them before they produce harm.

The practices that the field has produced — the integrated protocols that combine traditional training with neurotechnological support — are available, through the commons fund, to anyone who wants to undergo them. Not free in the sense of requiring no investment: they require serious commitment, years of practice, genuine willingness to engage with the difficult interior territory that genuine contemplative development always requires. But free in the sense of not requiring money or privilege or access to specific cultural traditions. The geography of who has access to serious contemplative development has expanded dramatically, in ways that the traditions alone could never have achieved.

**The governance battles** have continued, as they always will. But the principles established in the 2030s have held — not because the pressures against them have reduced, but because the institutions that defend them have strengthened. The Cognitive Rights movement of the 2030s, which was young and often reactive, has become by 2050 a mature political tradition: with sophisticated legal capacity, with genuine expertise in the technologies it is governing, with the kind of long institutional memory that allows it to recognize the new forms of old power moves when they appear.

The techno-sovereign tendency has not given up. It is more sophisticated, better disguised, more patient than it was in the 2030s. But it is also facing a population that has been educated by two decades of the cognitive rights culture, that takes cognitive sovereignty seriously as a personal value rather than only a political principle, and that is better equipped to recognize cognitive manipulation when it occurs.

**Marcus, at 62**, has written the book that synthesizes what twenty-five years of governance design work has produced. He is spending most of his time on what he describes as the work of the third act: not building institutions, which he has done, and not training the people who will run them, which he has done, but going into the deepest questions of the work itself — the questions about what human consciousness is for and how governance relates to it that have always been underneath the practical questions and that he now has the time and the depth to actually pursue.

He describes this as the strangest part of his life: the feeling of having built what he was trying to build, well enough that it will continue without him, and finding himself at sixty-two in the position that Marcus-at-thirty-four had sensed was the real position: at the frontier of what nobody knows, with nothing to guide him but the question.

**Elena**, at 72, is not running the lab anymore — she passed that to Benjamin a decade ago. She is doing something that does not have a name: going into the territory her research has been pointing toward, not as a scientist but as a practitioner. She has been practicing for fifteen years, seriously, with the discipline she brought to science and the humility of someone who knows that the territory she is entering is harder to map than anything she has mapped before. She reports, in conversations with people she trusts, things she is careful not to publish — careful because the language for them does not exist, careful because the phenomena are real but the framework for evaluating them is not yet rigorous enough to be scientific. She is gathering the vocabulary. She is doing the work that the next generation of researchers will need her to have done: going into the territory, returning with the best description she can give, accepting that the description will be imperfect.

**Aisha**, at 28, is doing mathematics that her field is still absorbing. Not publishing at an extraordinary rate — she publishes rarely, and what she publishes is dense and demanding and takes years for the field to fully process. She is, by general agreement of the people who can evaluate the work, producing the most significant mathematics being done. She is also, by her own account, still asking the question Dr. Chen answered when she was eleven: *why does it go forever?* The answer, as she now understands it: because the questions generate by genuinely going deep into anything are always larger than the territory you have covered. The forever is not a property of mathematics. It is a property of genuine depth, in any domain. The domain goes as far as the attention can reach, and genuine attention has no bottom.

## 2100

Here I reach the true edge of what can be seen from here, and I want to be honest about that before I proceed.

The civilization of 2100 will have had seventy-five years of the new institutions. The first generation raised entirely inside them will be old, passing their accumulated experience to grandchildren who have never known the world before the transition. The knowledge that the new civilization was built to develop — the knowledge of consciousness that the contemplative traditions have always been building, now accelerated and broadened by the scientific understanding and the neurotechnological support — will have had three generations to accumulate.

What can be said about this civilization, with any confidence?

**The vocabulary will be richer.** Every expansion of consciousness in human history has been followed by the development of new vocabulary for what the expanded consciousness encounters. The people who developed philosophical argument needed new terms that oral culture had not required. The people who developed mathematical proof needed terms that philosophical argument had not required. The people who develop the forms of experience that the consciousness engineering produces will need terms that the current vocabulary does not provide.

These terms will exist, by 2100, in ordinary use — the way "theory" and "proof" and "hypothesis" are in ordinary use today, though they were technical terms in the early days of philosophy and science. The people of 2100 will describe their inner experience in terms that we cannot fully understand from here, not because the terms are obscure but because the experience they describe is not yet available to us. We will be able to read the descriptions, recognize them as descriptions of something, and not quite understand what that something is.

This is the condition of every generation looking at the vocabulary of a more developed civilization: not foreign, not incomprehensible, but pointing at something the current vocabulary does not reach.

**The contemplative traditions will have been integrated.** Not synthesized into a single unified tradition — that is not how genuine intellectual traditions develop. They will have been integrated in the sense that the core insights of each tradition — the specific forms of development each has cultivated, the specific failure modes each has identified, the specific vocabulary each has developed for the territory it has explored — will be available to any serious practitioner, regardless of their cultural background or starting tradition.

This integration is already happening in 2038. By 2100 it will have had sixty years more to develop. The result will be a contemplative culture that is, at its serious end, as sophisticated and as rigorous as the scientific culture — built on the same principles of honest investigation, accumulated evidence, identification of failure modes, and continuous revision in the direction of more accurate understanding.

**The governance battles will have produced a mature framework.** Not perfect — the conflict between concentrated power and distributed governance is permanent; it is built into the structure of human civilization and does not resolve, only gets managed better or worse. But by 2100, the governance of consciousness technology will have enough institutional history, enough accumulated wisdom about what works and what fails, enough trained practitioners, to be genuinely robust against the most sophisticated forms of capture.

The cognitive rights framework will be embedded in international law in a way that makes it as difficult to undo as the prohibition on slavery is now — not impossible, human beings have managed to undo things that seemed permanent, but requiring such sustained and visible effort to undo that the attempt would generate the resistance that makes success unlikely.

**The question of what consciousness is for will be more alive, not less.** This is the thing I most want to say about 2100, and the thing I am least able to fully substantiate from here.

Every expansion of cognitive capacity has raised the question of what the expanded capacity is for with new urgency. The invention of writing made possible new forms of harm alongside new forms of good. The capacity for philosophical argument was deployed in the service of slavery before it was deployed in the service of abolition. Mathematical science produced weapons before it produced vaccines. Each expansion of what human minds can do raises the ethical question — *what should this be for?* — with a force proportional to the expansion.

By 2100, the expansion of cognitive capacity will be far enough along that the ethical question will be raised with a force that dwarfs anything the previous expansions produced. Not because the people of 2100 will be worse at ethics than us — I believe they will be better, for reasons that this book has tried to articulate. But because the stakes will be higher, and higher stakes raise harder questions.

What is extended simultaneity for? Not what can it do — what *should* it do? What forms of experience and knowing and relation is it most important to develop, and why? What is embodied abstraction most correctly applied to — the understanding of physical systems, the development of compassion, the resolution of political conflict, all of these, something else? What is collaborative interiority for, and who should participate in it, and what happens to the civilization's accountability structures when the distinction between individual perspective and collective perspective has changed?

These questions cannot be answered from here. But they will be the central questions of 2100 in the same way that the questions of consciousness and meaning are the central questions of 2038. And the civilization that has spent seventy-five years building the institutions and practices and governance frameworks described in this book will approach these questions better equipped than any previous civilization has been equipped to approach the hard questions of its moment.

Not perfectly equipped. Not immune to catastrophic error. Better equipped.

Better is what is achievable. Better is enough.

## The Question That Remains

In 2100, and in 2200, and in 2500, and as far as the extension of this trajectory can be imagined — the question that will still be there, still unresolved, still the deepest question any conscious being faces, is not *what can consciousness do?*

It is *what is consciousness for?*

The expansion of what consciousness can do does not answer what it should do. The extension of the capacity for experience does not determine what experience is worth having. The deepening of the mind's powers does not resolve what the mind's powers should be turned toward.

This is the question that the contemplative traditions have always circled: not how to think more, or feel more, or know more, but what the thinking and feeling and knowing is *in service of*. What the developed mind is developed *toward*. What the most awake and present and capable human being does with their wakefulness and presence and capability.

It cannot be answered by technology. Not by ASI. Not by the best governance framework. Not by the most sophisticated consciousness engineering. Not by the richest vocabulary ever developed for the territory of inner experience. It requires the old things: wisdom, developed through long attention to one's own experience and the experience of others. Love, the specific love of specific people that makes their flourishing genuinely matter. The willingness to ask the question honestly, without demanding an answer that the question cannot yet give.

The new civilization is building the conditions for this question to be asked with greater seriousness, by more people, with more of the interior resources that the question requires. This is what the schools of depth and the new monasteries and the contemplative practices and the consciousness engineering are all, finally, building toward: not the answer, but the capacity to ask well.

The answer will be lived. Not built.

That was always true.

It is still true.

It will be true in 2100.
