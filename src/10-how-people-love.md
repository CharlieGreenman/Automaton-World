# CHAPTER TEN: HOW PEOPLE LOVE

### *Relationships after the economy of scarcity*

The productivity era had a profound and mostly unexamined effect on love.

Not in the obvious ways — not only by making people too busy for relationships, though it did that too, in ways that produced genuine harm. In something more structural: the economic conditions of the previous civilization organized the deepest human relationships around a set of constraints that people rarely examined because the constraints felt like facts of life rather than contingencies.

You married the person you could afford to marry, at the age the biological and career clocks aligned. You stayed married partly because the economic and social costs of leaving were substantial. You lived near your work rather than near your family or your chosen community, and your social world contracted to the people who happened to be geographically accessible. You maintained relationships through the obligation of proximity and mutual dependence rather than through the deliberate choice of people who had found each other worth finding.

None of this was all bad. Constraint is not only a limit. The person who commits to a relationship because the alternative is prohibitively expensive sometimes, through the sustained presence that the commitment forces, discovers depths in that relationship that would not have appeared without the forcing. Obligation and love are not opposites. The structures that organized the productivity era's relationships were not wrong. They were shaped by conditions that have now changed, and with the conditions, the structures have changed.

## What Changed: Pace

People take longer to form serious commitments. The urgency that characterized the formation of romantic partnership in the productivity era — the sense that time was running out, that the biological window for children was closing, that the career years were the years when partnership needed to be established, that waiting meant risking missing the chance entirely — has relaxed.

Not entirely. Biology is not economics. The body has its own timelines, and they have not been abolished by the material changes in the civilization. Women who want to bear children have bodies that continue to have preferences about when. The desire for partnership, the specific longing for the particular intimacy of committed life with one specific person, does not wait politely for the conditions to be right.

But the conditions have changed enough that people can afford to know each other properly before deciding to build a life together. The six-month courtship that had become the de facto standard in the productive era — compressed by the sense that time was scarce and the right person should be recognized quickly and secured — has given way to something longer, more honest, more informed. Not always. The urgency of attraction does not respect timelines. But the culture has shifted toward a recognition that serious commitment is the result of serious knowing, and serious knowing requires time.

This slower pace produces, on average, partnerships that are more honestly formed. Not necessarily more stable — stability is not the only criterion of a good relationship, and some relationships that end quickly end because they were entered honestly and discovered honestly to have run their course. But more free: more organized around genuine fit and genuine choice, less organized around the convergence of constraints and calendar.

## What Changed: Form

The form of the family expanded.

The nuclear family — two adults, children, a private household as the primary unit of care and economic organization — did not disappear. It is still the most common configuration of serious adult commitment in most communities of the new civilization. But it ceased to be the dominant and almost exclusive model, the model against which all other arrangements were implicitly measured and found lacking.

What emerged alongside it, and sometimes replaced it, were extended and intentional configurations that the previous era's culture could not easily accommodate. Groups of adults — three, five, eight, sometimes more — who have chosen to build shared life together, with or without romantic partnership at the center. Extended families living in genuine proximity, sharing the responsibilities and the pleasures of daily life in ways that the isolated nuclear household cannot. Chosen families: constellations of people who are not biologically related and who have no formal legal relationship but who have committed to each other with the seriousness that formal relationships carry, and who organize their lives to reflect that commitment.

These configurations were not new. Extended families have always existed. Chosen families have always been chosen. Communities organized around shared life have been attempted throughout human history, with mixed results. What was new was the removal of the economic pressure that had made these configurations so difficult to sustain.

The intentional community had, in the productivity era, an almost invariable failure mode: it could not survive the economic pressure of a world organized around individual productivity. The adults in the community had to work, and working required time and energy that the community needed, and the tension between the demands of the economy and the demands of the community was almost always resolved in favor of the economy, because the economy held the material survival that the community could not provide.

When the material survival is provided independently — when each adult in the community has the unconditional material floor of the endowment — the communities that form are freed from this tension. They still face the tensions that any community of human beings faces: the tensions of different needs and different temperaments and different visions of what the community is for. But these tensions are navigable in ways that the economic tension was not, because they can be addressed through the same practice that makes the community worth being in: genuine, honest conversation between people who are committed to each other.

## What Did Not Change: Difficulty

The difficulty of genuine intimacy did not change.

The work of knowing another person — really knowing them, not knowing your projection of them, not knowing the person they perform in the context of your relationship — remained as demanding as it had always been. More demanding, in some ways: the new civilization's emphasis on depth and genuine engagement set a higher standard for what relationships were supposed to offer, and higher standards are harder to meet.

The temptation to settle for something less — for comfortable familiarity, for the simulation of intimacy without its substance, for the pleasant fiction that you know someone you have never really been curious enough about to actually discover — is as present as it has ever been. More present, some people report: because the time available for genuine intimacy also provides time for the avoidance of it, the elaborate self-distraction that is so much more comfortable than actually encountering another person.

The grief of loss did not change. People died — and die — and the extension of lifespan has not eliminated mortality, only deferred it further. Relationships ended — and end — not only through death but through the ordinary dissolution of partnerships that have run their course. The specific love that lived in the specific configuration of two specific people ended with that configuration, and no amount of material security or community support made that grief anything other than grief.

The vertigo of being genuinely known did not change. The experience of allowing another person to see you with accuracy rather than flattering incomprehension — of being encountered in the parts of yourself that you do not show the world, the parts that are frightened or contradictory or not yet formed — remained the most courageous ordinary thing a person could do. The new civilization did not make it easier. It provided more support for the person who had done it: more community around them, more models for what genuine intimacy looks like, more cultural permission for the vulnerability that genuine intimacy requires.

## What Did Not Change: Children

The desire for children did not change, and neither did the basic reality of what raising them requires.

What changed was the context. The parents of the new civilization raise their children in proximity to extended family, in community with other families, with time that the productivity era had routinely denied: time to be actually present with children, to participate in the slow, irreplaceable, irreducibly human work of formation that cannot be outsourced to systems however sophisticated.

The previous era's parenting was shaped, often severely, by time scarcity: the parents who worked, which was most parents, who had children, who had limited time, who had to choose constantly between being present with their children and managing the practical requirements of lives organized primarily around productive work. The school day was designed to contain children while parents worked. The activities that filled children's schedules were often organized around the requirements of future productive life rather than the present requirements of a developing person.

The new civilization's parenting is shaped differently. The time is there — the time that the previous era had yearned for and could not provide. The extended family and community are there — the other adults who know the child and who constitute the village that the previous era had correctly identified as necessary but had not been able to preserve. The question of *what am I preparing my child for?* has a different answer — or rather, a different frame for the question. Not: what career? But: what kind of person? Not: what skills for the economy? But: what quality of attention, what depth of engagement, what capacity for genuine relation, what understanding of what their own life is for?

These questions are harder to answer than the career questions. They require that the parents have done some version of their own work — have gone deep enough into their own experience to have some genuine sense of what depth produces and what it is for. This is the demand the new civilization makes of parents that the old civilization rarely made explicit: that you have thought about what a life well-lived looks like, because your child is watching and the model matters more than the instruction.

## The Long Partnerships

A particular form of relationship has emerged in the new civilization as one of its most distinctive features: the very long partnership.

Not long in the sense of staying together out of inertia or obligation — that happens, as it always has, and is not what I mean. Long in the sense of genuine development over time: relationships that have lasted twenty, thirty, forty years and that are richer in their fifth decade than they were in their first, because the people in them have been growing and the relationship has been growing with them.

These relationships were possible before. They occurred in the previous civilization. But they were significantly harder to sustain against the pressures that the productivity era placed on partnerships: the time scarcity, the economic stress, the geographic mobility, the career demands that routinely took precedence over relationship demands, the culture of self-optimization that encouraged people to evaluate all of their choices, including relationship choices, in terms of what they were personally getting from them.

In the new civilization, the conditions for long partnership have improved. The time is there for the slow work of genuinely knowing someone over years. The extended family and community provide the support that long partnerships need: the people around the partnership who know it, who hold the couple's history, who can name things that the people inside the partnership cannot see. The culture's emphasis on depth extends to relationships: the long partnership is celebrated not as a feat of endurance but as a form of depth — the specific depth that comes from having gone genuinely into another person's experience over enough time that the person has become genuinely surprising to you, again and again, in ways that no shorter acquaintance could produce.

The people in very long partnerships describe something consistent enough that it deserves to be named: at some point, after years of sustained genuine encounter, the relationship becomes irreducibly particular in a way that earlier stages could not have been. The person is not interchangeable with anyone else — not because of habit or obligation, but because the specific configuration of this specific relationship has produced something that exists nowhere else. The conversations they can only have with each other. The history no one else shares. The way one person's attention can find, in the other, things that neither had found alone.

This is not available at the beginning of any relationship. It is not available after five years, usually, or ten. It is the specific product of sustained genuine encounter over many years, and it is, by the consistent report of the people who have it, among the best things available to a human being.

## What the New Civilization Offers Love

The new civilization does not make love easier. It makes love more possible.

It removes the external constraints that had so often prevented people from finding each other, knowing each other, building life together in configurations that suited them. It provides the material security that prevents the most corrosive distortions of scarcity from entering the intimate bond. It provides the community that makes the long partnership sustainable and the extended family that gives children more than two adults as sources of genuine care and genuine knowing.

It does not remove the internal constraints — the fear of genuine intimacy, the preference for the simulation of knowing over the risk of actual encounter, the thousand small cowardices that prevent people from being fully present with the people they love. These remain exactly as demanding as they have always been. The work of genuine love is the same work it has always been: the willingness to be known, the willingness to know, the willingness to stay through the difficulty that genuine knowing sometimes produces, and to come through the difficulty into something that could not have been reached from the outside.

The new civilization provides better conditions for this work. It does not do the work for anyone.

That, as it has always been, is up to us.
