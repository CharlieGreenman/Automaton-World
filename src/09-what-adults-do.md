# CHAPTER NINE: WHAT ADULTS DO

### *The full range of human activity when work is no longer the organizer*

The question people asked in the early years of the transition — *what will people do when the machines do the work?* — was answered in the most human way possible: in every direction at once.

The answer was not uniform. This was the thing that surprised the economists and the planners and the futurists who had tried to model the post-scarcity civilization — that the diversity of what people chose to do, freed from the organizing pressure of labor markets, exceeded any model's capacity to contain it. The labor market sorted people into the roles it needed; released from that sorting, people sorted themselves into the roles they actually wanted. And it turned out that what people actually wanted, across cultures and temperaments and histories, was more varied, more interesting, and in many cases more genuinely productive — in the original sense: producing something of real value — than what the labor market had been organizing them to do.

Let me describe the range.

## Governance: The Major New Human Occupation

The most unexpected outcome of the transition — unexpected to economists, to political scientists, and to most of the people who experienced it — was the emergence of community governance as the single largest category of meaningful human activity.

Not governance in the glamorous sense: not national politics, though that continues, transformed and often improved by the new civic culture. Not the governance of great institutions, though that too continues. Governance in the local, unglamorous, essential sense: the community council that decides how the commons fund is used this year, the school governance body that hires teachers and evaluates whether the school is genuinely doing what it exists to do, the neighborhood assembly that resolves conflicts between community members and maintains the physical and social fabric of shared life, the regional coordination bodies that knit together networks of communities in ways that preserve their autonomy while enabling the cooperation that their size alone could not support.

In the productivity era, governance was something that happened mostly at a distance, performed by professionals and elected representatives while ordinary people concentrated their attention on their productive work. The logic was straightforward: producing and exchanging goods and services required most of people's time and energy, governance was complex and important but could be delegated to specialists, and the division of labor that organized productive activity could organize political activity too.

The cascade dissolved the first part of this logic. When productive work was no longer the organizing demand on most people's time and energy, the rationale for delegating governance dissolved with it. The decisions that needed to be made — how to allocate the commons fund, how to design the school, how to resolve the ongoing conflict between the community that wants to expand its shared garden and the community that values the open space — could not wait for distant professionals. They needed the people who lived with the consequences.

What this produced, in the communities that figured it out, was governance that was more direct, more personal, more honest, and more effective than anything operating at a distance could be. The council that allocates the local commons fund is composed of people who know the applicants, who understand the community's specific needs, who will live with the consequences of their decisions in the most immediate sense — they will encounter the funded institution and its participants daily, and the community will form judgments about their wisdom.

The people who do governance well in the new civilization are not the ones who are best at political maneuvering or most comfortable with public performance. They are the ones who can hold the genuine complexity of a community's competing needs in mind simultaneously, who can articulate what different people want in terms that make the different wants commensurable, who can guide the process of collective decision toward something workable without anyone feeling that the process violated them. This is the ancient skill of the wise elder, and it turns out — as the previous book argued and as the new civilization has confirmed empirically — that wisdom of this kind is neither rare nor the exclusive property of the old. Young people with genuine maturity develop it. People who have done serious contemplative practice develop it. People who have spent years in genuine relation with others develop it.

Governance at this scale is time-consuming. It requires showing up, consistently, to the meetings that most democratic systems have trouble getting people to attend. In the new civilization, showing up is not the problem: people have time, and the decisions being made in these meetings are the decisions that directly shape their daily lives. The problems are different: the slowness of genuine deliberation, the difficulty of maintaining the quality of attention required for good collective judgment over long periods, the tendency of any group to develop internal politics that distort the ostensible purpose.

The communities that have gotten governance right have done so by treating it as a practice — in exactly the sense that meditation is a practice, or craft is a practice: something that requires regular attention, that develops with experience, that has failure modes that can be identified and addressed, and that rewards deep engagement with qualities that shallow engagement cannot produce.

## Teaching and Mentorship

Teaching survived the transition with its importance not merely intact but increased, for a reason that the credential economy had always obscured: what teaching is, at its deepest level, was never primarily about information transfer.

Information transfer, the AI systems do extraordinarily. The student who wants to know anything — the history of any event, the proof of any theorem, the technique of any craft — has access to explanations of quality that no individual teacher could match on every topic, available at any time, in any language, at any level of depth requested. The informational function of education has been effectively automated.

What has not been automated, and cannot be automated without ceasing to be the thing it is: the development of a person in a domain, the relationship between someone who has gone genuinely deep and someone who is beginning to go deep, the transmission of not just what the domain contains but how to be someone who navigates it well.

The masters — people who have spent decades in genuine encounter with a specific domain and who have developed, through that encounter, both deep knowledge of the domain and the capacity to recognize and guide the development of depth in others — are among the most important people in the new civilization. Not in a status sense, though they are respected. In a functional sense: they are doing something irreplaceable, at a scale that the civilization depends on.

Teaching at this level is itself a practice of depth. Dr. Chen's thirty years of working with mathematically developing students have made him a better mathematician, not in the sense of producing more mathematical output, but in the sense of his understanding of what mathematics is — of what goes on in a mind encountering mathematical structure for the first time, of what makes a proof beautiful in the specific way that some proofs are beautiful, of what the domain's deepest questions are and why they remain deep. Teaching, done with genuine attention, goes in both directions: the teacher is also being taught, by the encounter with minds in different stages of development, about the domain that both are inhabiting.

## Physical Care: The Irreducibly Human Work

Elder care, childcare, the care of the seriously ill — all of these required, in the post-ASI world as before it, the presence of a human body attending to another human body, with the consciousness that comes with the body.

AI systems assist with these forms of care in important ways. They monitor health indicators. They manage medications, schedules, the logistics of care. They provide companionship of a kind — conversation, entertainment, the cognitive engagement that reduces loneliness. But they cannot be present in the way that presence actually means. The hand held by a person who genuinely cares about you is categorically different from the hand held by a system that has been designed to simulate caring. This is not a sentimental observation. It has observable consequences: people in genuine human care recover faster, suffer less, and report higher quality of life than people whose care is primarily managed by systems, even systems of extraordinary competence.

The recognition of this — which the previous era had known as a principle but had not organized its healthcare system around, because the labor cost of genuine human care was prohibitive when human labor was economically scarce — changed the organization of care in the new civilization. Physical care is not a residual category, the work left over after the intelligent work has been automated. It is one of the primary categories of human occupation, done by people who understand it as genuine vocation: as work that requires real skill, genuine presence, the development of the particular form of wisdom that comes from sustained attention to human suffering and human fragility.

The people who do this work are not doing something less than the people who do mathematics or governance or science. They are doing something that is equally demanding in its own dimensions — the demands of sustained presence with suffering, the skill of knowing when to act and when to witness, the wisdom about how to accompany a person through the experiences that no optimization can prevent.

## Craft and Making

A census of how people spend their hours in the new civilization would have surprised the industrial era. Enormous amounts of human time go into the making of things: furniture, clothing, food, musical instruments, buildings, objects of beauty and utility that could have been produced more efficiently by automated systems and that are made by hand anyway, because the making is the point.

The relationship between the maker and the made object in the new civilization is different from the relationship between worker and product in the old. In the old relationship, the product was the point: it had to meet a specification, satisfy a customer, compete in a market. The process of making it was instrumental — a means to the product, and faster and better if the means were faster and better. The craftsperson who could meet the specification without the long apprenticeship was better at meeting the specification.

In the new relationship, the process is the point: the engagement of the maker's intelligence with the material, the development of knowledge that lives in the hands and the eye, the particular form of presence that sustained making produces. The product matters — a badly made thing is a failure, and the standard is maintained — but the criterion is not primarily market fitness. It is the quality of the engagement it represents: did the maker go genuinely deep into the problem of this object, did she bring to it the full resource of her developed skill, does the object carry evidence of the care that produced it?

This is not a romantic fantasy about pre-industrial craft. The craftspeople of the new civilization use AI tools extensively — for design, for material analysis, for access to the tradition's accumulated knowledge. A furniture maker who ignores what the AI systems know about wood grain and joinery dynamics is not being more traditional. She is being less careful. The AI's knowledge is available and should be used, in the same way that any tradition's knowledge should be used: not as a substitute for the maker's own judgment and skill, but as one of the resources the judgment and skill can draw on.

What the AI cannot substitute for is the judgment itself: the feel for the specific piece of wood on the specific morning, the decision about the joint that follows from decades of experiencing what works and what fails, the sense of what the object is trying to become that guides a thousand small choices that cannot all be articulated.

## Contemplative Practice as Occupation

This requires careful statement, because the phrase is easily misunderstood.

What I mean is specific: the serious, sustained, years-long investigation of consciousness — practices of attention and inquiry that develop the quality of awareness available to the person who undertakes them, in ways that the new civilization has come to recognize as important not just personally but collectively. The people who have gone deeply into this practice have knowledge that the civilization needs: knowledge about what consciousness is like when it is genuinely developed, about the failure modes of that development, about the conditions that support it and the conditions that undermine it.

These people — contemplative practitioners with genuine depth — are not monks in the sense of being separated from ordinary life. They are fully embedded in community, involved in governance and teaching and the ordinary activities of daily life. The contemplative practice is one dimension of a full life, not a withdrawal from life into a specialized institution.

But it is a genuine occupation in the sense that it takes time, requires sustained engagement, and produces real results — results that the person who has undergone the practice experiences directly and that the people around them experience indirectly. The contemplative whose quality of attention has been genuinely developed is a different kind of person in every context — more present, more able to hold complexity without reactivity, more capable of the kind of genuine relation that the new civilization depends on. The practice is not separate from the other activities of the new civilization. It is one of the conditions that make those activities possible at their best.

## The People Who Drift

I do not want to paint the new civilization as one in which everyone has found their depth and the human problem of meaning has been solved. It has not.

The transition that provided material security did not automatically provide the practices and communities and genuine engagements that material security makes possible. The provision of possibility is not the same as the realization of possibility. Many people received the unconditional material floor and found themselves without the orientation to use it well.

The languishing that the previous book identified as one of the characteristic pathologies of the pre-ASI developed world has not disappeared. It has changed shape. In the old world, languishing was often the result of overwork, of having no time for depth because the demands of productive contribution consumed everything. In the new world, languishing is often the result of the opposite: having time and not knowing what to do with it, having security without the structure that makes security something other than emptiness.

The communities that address this best do not address it through programs or therapies or structured interventions, though all of these play some role. They address it through the oldest available medicine: genuine community, which means that the person who is drifting is surrounded by people who know them well enough to notice the drift, who care enough to name it, and who have enough genuine engagement with their own lives to model what genuine engagement looks like.

This is the most important thing the new civilization offers the drifting person: proximity to people who are not drifting. The person who has gone deep into something — who is genuinely engaged, genuinely alive in their particular form of depth — is one of the most powerful influences available on a person who has not found their depth yet. Not through instruction, not through evangelism, but through the simple fact of their presence and example.

The civilization organized around depth produces people who have gone deep, and their presence makes depth more accessible to the people around them. This is not a guarantee. It is a condition — a more favorable condition than anything the productivity era provided.
