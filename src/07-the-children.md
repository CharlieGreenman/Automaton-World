# CHAPTER SEVEN: THE CHILDREN

### *What it means to grow up knowing what they know*

Aisha is eleven years old.

She has never taken a standardized test. She has never been graded. She has never prepared for a career or been asked to think about one. She has spent the last three years in deep study of mathematics with a teacher named Dr. Chen, who is sixty-three years old and who, in the old world, would have been publishing papers at a research university somewhere, engaged in the peculiar productivity performance that the academic system required even of people whose primary gift was for teaching. In the new world, he is here — in this specific community school of depth, with twelve students between the ages of nine and fourteen who have chosen mathematics as their primary domain, and who spend the morning in the particular encounter with structure and proof that Dr. Chen has made his life's work to transmit.

Aisha is extraordinary. Dr. Chen has been working with mathematically gifted young people for thirty years, and he knows extraordinary when he encounters it. But he does not teach her toward extraordinary. He teaches her toward depth — the quality of engagement with the subject that makes the subject genuinely hers, that transforms it from a set of techniques to a way of seeing. The extraordinary will take care of itself, he has always believed, if the depth is real.

What she knows, at eleven, that her parents did not know at thirty: that difficulty is interesting, not threatening. That uncertainty is the beginning of inquiry, not its failure. That genuine understanding requires sitting with a problem long enough to feel its shape from the inside — and that the feeling of understanding, the click of a proof coming together, the sudden sense of *why* the theorem must be true rather than just that it is — is among the best experiences available to a human being.

She knows these things not because someone told her but because she has experienced them, repeatedly, in three years of genuine encounter with mathematical structure. This is the thing the schools of depth are for: not the transmission of information but the provision of the experience of depth itself, early enough in a life that the depth becomes familiar — becomes what learning feels like, rather than an exception to the learning that feels like something else.

## What the Schools of Depth Actually Are

A school of depth, in its mature form — and they are still maturing, still being designed and redesigned as the civilization learns what works — has between twenty and two hundred students. It has a small number of teachers: masters in their domains who have chosen to transmit their knowledge rather than continue producing output, who have accepted that teaching at this level is itself a form of depth, and who bring to the relationship with students the same quality of sustained attention they bring to the domain itself.

The school has no fixed curriculum in the industrial sense, because curriculum implies a sequence of content to be delivered on a schedule — implies that what is being transferred is information, and that the transfer can be planned in advance. The school of depth is organized not around information but around experience: the experience of going genuinely deep into something, of encountering the authentic complexity and beauty of a domain, of developing the specific quality of mind that the domain rewards and requires.

What it has instead of curriculum is a practice: a way of engaging with a domain that the teacher has developed over decades and that the student apprentices herself to. In mathematics, the practice looks like proof and conversation — the sustained encounter with what it means for something to be necessarily true, and the collaborative reasoning about why. In history, it looks like deep reading of primary sources in dialogue across centuries, treating the writers of the past as contemporaries with whom genuine argument is possible. In biology, it looks like sustained attention to living systems: close observation, careful questioning, the development of intuition about the logic of life that only time with specific organisms produces.

The AI systems that permeate the new civilization play a specific and carefully delimited role in the schools of depth. They are remarkable research partners for teachers: Dr. Chen uses his ASI collaborator to explore mathematical territory adjacent to what his students are studying, to find the historically interesting proofs that illuminate the structure his students are beginning to understand, to generate the specific problems that will challenge each student at exactly the right level of difficulty. The system knows more mathematics than any human mathematician, and it helps Dr. Chen know what it knows.

But the system cannot teach. This sounds like a limitation of current technology, and it is partly that. But it is also something more fundamental. Teaching, at the level that the schools of depth require, is not information transfer. It is the transmission of a way of being in relation to a domain — and this transmission requires the presence of someone who has that way of being, who embodies it in every interaction with the domain and with the students, and who can recognize its development (or its absence) in another person.

The student who learns mathematics primarily from an AI system learns the content without learning the practice. She learns *that* certain things are true without learning *how* to be someone who finds out whether things are true. She develops computational competence without developing mathematical sensibility — the judgment about what questions are interesting, what approaches are promising, what a result means and how significant it is.

Mathematical sensibility, like all genuine forms of judgment, is transmitted by presence. Not exclusively — books and problems and the domain itself contribute enormously. But the human teacher is the irreplaceable element: the one who can look at a student's wrong proof and see, in the specific nature of the wrongness, exactly where the student's understanding has a gap, and ask exactly the question that will help the student find the gap herself.

## The Texture of a Day at School

At seven-thirty in the morning, twelve students arrive at the building where Dr. Chen's school occupies the ground floor and garden. The building is not purpose-built — it was converted from a warehouse, with the ceilings that warehouses have and the light that tall windows admit, and with a garden that spills through the back glass doors into a space that has been growing for five years and that shows it.

They come from the community within a fifteen-minute walk. Most of them have already eaten — the community kitchen starts at six and runs until eight, and several of the students are there every morning, eating Thomas's bread and talking to whoever else is there. This is not a designed part of the school experience. It is what happens when a school is embedded in a community rather than isolated from it.

The morning begins with forty-five minutes of silence. Not enforced silence — the students can whisper, can move, can work on problems individually. What is asked is that the quality of attention settle: that the social energy of arrival, the news of the morning, the ambient distraction, be set aside in favor of something slower and more inward. Several of the students spend this time in contemplative practice of the kind they have learned in the community; others work on the problems they have been sitting with; Aisha almost always begins immediately writing, filling her notebook with the thinking she has been doing since she woke up.

Then mathematics. Three hours, in the configuration that Dr. Chen has developed over thirty years and continues to refine: an hour of collective work on a single problem, chosen by Dr. Chen for its difficulty and its productivity — problems that cannot be solved quickly, that require real thinking, that contain within them the next level of understanding the students are ready to reach for. An hour of individual work on the problems the students have brought to the session, the problems that have been following each of them from the previous session. An hour of conversation: about what each student found, what confused them, what the results mean, what the next question is.

The conversation hour is where Dr. Chen does his most important work. He rarely talks for more than a few minutes consecutively. He asks. He listens. He asks again. He notices what a student's answer reveals about the structure of their understanding, and he asks the question that will make the structure visible to the student herself. He is not Socratic in the manipulative sense — he is not leading students to predetermined conclusions through artfully designed questions. He is genuinely curious about how each student is thinking, genuinely uncertain about how each student's understanding will develop, and genuinely committed to following the student's thinking rather than directing it.

Aisha finds this maddening and essential in equal measure. She is accustomed to knowing things — to being the fastest in any room to the answer, to finding most questions less interesting than the next question. Dr. Chen's questions slow her down. They require her to account for things she had skipped, to build what she had intuited into something solid enough that another person could stand on it. This is not comfortable. It is exactly what she needs.

## What the Children Know

The children of the new civilization know things that their parents do not, and the knowledge is not primarily informational.

They are, on average, more comfortable with genuine uncertainty. The culture they are being raised in — in the schools of depth, in the contemplative communities, in the communities of relation — has a different relationship to not-knowing than the culture that preceded it. The previous culture treated uncertainty as a problem to be solved: you were uncertain, and the appropriate response was to acquire information until you were certain. The new culture treats uncertainty as a condition of serious inquiry: you are uncertain, and the appropriate response is to go deeper into the uncertainty, to map its structure, to find the questions that can be investigated and the questions that cannot, to distinguish between the uncertainty that will yield to evidence and the uncertainty that is constitutive of the domain.

They are, on average, more attentive — not to screens, which they use with the calibrated intentionality of people who have been raised to understand what screens are good for and what they are not, but to the actual world of physical presence. More likely to notice the quality of light in the afternoon, the texture of the bread they are eating, the specific quality of another person's attention. This attentiveness has been developed deliberately, in the schools and in the contemplative practices, because it is the precondition of everything the new civilization values. You cannot go deep into mathematics without the quality of attention that notices what the problem is actually asking. You cannot have genuine relation without the attention that notices what another person is actually saying. Attentiveness is not a nice-to-have. It is the foundation.

They are, on average, more honest about their own experience. The culture they inhabit is deeply committed to the distinction between genuine engagement and its performance — between going actually deep into something and going through the motions of depth. Children raised in this culture develop, early, a sensitivity to this distinction and a discomfort with performance that they cannot always articulate but that shapes their behavior. They are reluctant to say they understand something they do not understand. They are reluctant to claim a quality of engagement they have not achieved. This reluctance is not humility in the self-deprecating sense — it is something more like accuracy: a commitment to saying what is actually true about their inner experience, even when the truth is less impressive than the performance would be.

They are asking different questions than any previous generation. Not better questions in an absolute sense — some of the questions they ask are confused in ways that more experience will clarify. But questions organized differently: oriented toward *why* rather than *what*, toward the structure of understanding rather than its content, toward the quality of engagement rather than the quantity of knowledge. Daniel, at eight, asking why he was learning long division if the computer could do it better, was asking a version of the question that the whole civilization has been learning to ask: *what is specifically human about this, and is it worth doing for what is specifically human about it?*

## The Hardest Thing About Growing Up Now

I do not want to present the childhood of the new civilization as uncomplicated. It is not.

The children know, with unusual directness, that the world they are inheriting is still being figured out. The adults around them are building institutions that have never been built before, making decisions with uncertain consequences, working from frameworks that are being developed in real time. The children can feel this — can feel the genuine uncertainty of the adults they trust — in a way that children in more stable eras, with more established answers to the basic civilizational questions, did not have to feel.

Some children find this energizing. The frontier quality of the situation — the sense that the questions are real and the answers not yet found — is exciting to certain kinds of minds, and the cultures of the new civilization, which tend to celebrate genuine inquiry over settled comfort, tend to develop these minds.

Some children find it genuinely frightening. The absence of established answers to the question of what adult life is for, the ongoing nature of the governance battles, the sense that the civilization they are inheriting is still fragile in ways the civilization of their grandparents was not — this produces real anxiety in some children, and the communities of the new civilization are learning, imperfectly, how to hold this anxiety without suppressing it.

The best communities do what the best parents have always done: they are honest about the uncertainty while being confident about the values. We do not know exactly what the future holds, and we are not pretending we do, and what we know is this: depth matters, attention matters, genuine relation matters, the quality of one's engagement with one's own life matters. These things are not uncertain. They have been confirmed by every serious investigation of human flourishing ever conducted. The architecture of the world around them will continue to change. These things will not.

## Aisha's Question

At the end of a morning session — after the forty-five-minute silence, after the three hours of mathematics, after the conversation — Aisha stays behind while the other students go to lunch.

Dr. Chen is at the board, erasing something, when she says: "Dr. Chen, why does mathematics feel like it goes forever?"

He turns around. He has been waiting, in the specific patient way he has developed over thirty years, for her to ask this question. He knew, from the quality of her engagement over the past month, that the question was forming.

"What do you mean by forever?" he asks.

"Like — every time I understand something, there's more. Every question I answer makes three more questions. The domain doesn't close. It just keeps opening."

"Yes," he says.

"Is that what all serious things are like?"

He thinks about this carefully, as he always does. "Yes," he says again. "Every domain that is genuinely deep has this quality. You go further in and you find more, not less. The very good chemist has more questions than the beginning chemistry student, not fewer. The very good painter sees more in a painting than the person looking at it for the first time."

"So you never finish?"

"You never finish."

She considers this. She does not look disappointed. She looks the way she looks when she has understood something that she had been approaching for a while.

"That's what makes it worth doing," she says.

He nods. She goes to lunch.

He stands at the board for a moment, alone in the classroom, and thinks: thirty years of teaching, and the best students still find this the same way. The domain goes forever. That is what makes it worth doing. The truth of it does not get old. It just deepens.

He erases the last of the morning's work from the board and prepares for the afternoon.
